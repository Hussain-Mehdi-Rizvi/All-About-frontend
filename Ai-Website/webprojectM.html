            especially
            computer systems. Examples of AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP),
            speech recognition and machine vision.</p>

            Narrow AI, also known as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) or weak AI, describes AI tools designed to
            carry out very specific actions or commands. ANI technologies are built to serve and excel in one cognitive
            capability, and cannot independently learn skills beyond its design. They often utilize machine learning and
            neural network algorithms to complete these specified tasks

            AGI technology would be on the level of a human mind. Due to this fact, it will probably be
            some time before we truly grasp AGI, as we still donâ€™t know all there is to know about the human brain
            itself. However, in concept at least, AGI would be able to think on the same level as a human, much like
            Sonny the robot in I-Robot featuring Will Smith.

            This is where it gets a little theoretical and a touch scary. ASI refers to AI technology that
            will match and then surpass the human mind. To be classed as an ASI, the technology would have to be more
            capable than a human in every single way possible. Not only could these AI things carry out tasks, but they
            would even be capable of having emotions and relationships.

                task will not automatically be applied to other task</p>
